# Food-Palace

Food palace is a portfolio project. It depicts an e-payment process typical of most online shops and restaurants. The app has a backdoor accessible to only the admin of the site via the dashboard link. The backdoor was built using a login required mixin as well as a user passes test mixin logic(checks if the logged in user is a staff account). A restriction was also made so that there'll be no way to create new user accounts. Think of it as a 2FA method.
